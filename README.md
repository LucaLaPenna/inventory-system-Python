PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Paisley Precision Engineering Company (PPEC) manufactures aircraft components. They make three different
types of component (Winglet Attachment Struts, Door Seal Clamp Handles and Rudder Pivot Pins), each of which
performs a critical function, must meet the very highest quality standards and must also be fully traceable
throughout its intended lifecycle. Each type of component is manufactured in small batches and individually
identified by both a manufacturers’ batch number and an individual component serial number to ensure traceability.
Components are manufactured in two stages. Firstly, each batch is cast and machined to produce complete (but
unfinished) components that are kept in the company’s warehouses. Whenever a customer orders a component(s)
they provide details of the finish they require, for example some customers prefer a polished metal finish while
others prefer a painted finish to match their corporate livery. Components are finished and held in the same
warehouse pending dispatch to the client.
Rudder Pivot Pins are manufactured in 3 different sizes (10mm diameter x 75mm length, 12mm diameter x 100mm
length and 16mm diameter x 150mm length) and are suitable for fitting to a wide variety of aircraft types. Door Seal
Clamp Handles are a universal fit for all aircraft and Winglet Attachment Struts will only fit a specific type of aircraft.
Currently Winglet Attachment Struts are manufactured for two aircraft types (Airbus A320 series and Airbus A380
series). The company operates from two locations. The main location in Paisley consists of foundry, machine shop,
warehouse and product finishing facilities. The second location in Dubai consists of a warehouse and a finishing
facility. Therefore, although all components are manufactured at Paisley the complete (but unfinished) components
may be stored and finished at either location.
You are required to design and implement an inventory system capable of recording and tracking each component
from manufacture, through storage to finishing.
